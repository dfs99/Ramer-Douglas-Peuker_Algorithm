The data this project admits must follow the following structure in order
to be processed.

1-.) the fist line must contain the epsilon error in order to perform the
     algorithm.
2-.) the second line must contain the total number of points within the file.
3-.) A point will be represented in two-dimensional plane where x coordinate
     will be in first place. Afterwards, the y coordinate should follow the x
     one separated by a comma. An example could be:
        1,2
        5,2
        100,43

4-.) Repeated points will be ignored by default.
5-.) The file that contains the solution will be a .txt that contains all the
     points successfully generated.
